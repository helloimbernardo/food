# Basic Cake

Recipe for a very basic cake.

## Ingredients

- 4-6 eggs
- 1 large cup/mug of sugar
- 2 large cups/mugs of flour
- Spoonful of baker's yeast (if the flour doesn't have any)
- lemon zest

## Recipe

1. Preheat the oven at 180ÂºC
2. Mix eggs and sugar for about 5 minutes in a blender 
3. Cover the base of the cake pan with butter and put some extra flour on top to prevent the cake dough from sticking
4. Put the flour in a container and add the mix of eggs and sugar. Add the baker's yeast if the flour doesn't have any. Mix all that for a while.
5. Pour on the cake pan and take it to the oven with a sheet of aluminium foil. Let it cook for 30 minutes, at which point check the cake with a toothpick to see if it's cooked. Remove from the oven at your own discretion.
